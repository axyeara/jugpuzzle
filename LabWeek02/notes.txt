Make sure to follow the "Feature Branch Workflow" when you are working on your assignments or labs

The process generally should be:
1. create a branch for new features or checkout an existing branch for existing features.
2. do your work
3. add and commit with a proper message
4. checkout other people changes and fix any merge conflicts
5. push your changes and merge your branch only if you are done

Add comments only necessary, no need to add comments over every line or lines that are simple and clear to understand.

Use proper names for your variables.

Use proper spaces and tabs, but do not over do it.
